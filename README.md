# The Aberystwyth Beach Cleanup Website

[Visit the live website here](https://ccrd1711.github.io/aber-cleanup/index.html)

With this website, I wanted to create a simple and appealing web-based introduction to a technically 'fake' charity. 
The 'charity', "Aberystwyth Beach Cleanup Charity", is based off of real-life activity that does happen here in mid-Wales and obviously world wide.
I myself have been part of a few beach cleans since my arrival here in 2016. However the only 'organisation' that currently exists for these is a Facebook group. 

My thought process going into this project was that I must try and think of something to 'sell', but I didn't want it to be too generic, or TOO much like any of the sample projects in the run-up modules. I also didn't want it to be a hard 'product' as such - this is just personal preference. So I thought about charities, which lead me down this route. And as much as Facebook groups in general do work well, I thought, well, "Why isn't there more organisation or action to do these cleanups?" I frequent the beach here regularly all year and there are times when it can be seen that a get-together is needed. 

My thought process progressed to: "Is the reasoning behind this purely just a time or motivation issue? Or could it be linked to something a bit deeper?" So, I thought, let's create this charity narrative for this - a charity always needs both more hands and finances to be able to propel the work. This gave me a sufficient basis for one or multiple CTA's, and also allowed me to be a bit more personal in my appearance of the site as I could source my own images. 

As you may be able to tell by the tone of this introduction so far, it has been written post-project. At the time of currently writing this ReadMe, all but two images on the website are my own. This section will be updated if I can source those myself before submission.
